# Advent Of Code AoC
This GitHub repository has all the code's in it that I made for advent of code separated by year. This README explains what AoC is. What I already made and what I have accomplished so far.

## What is AoC?

Advent Of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. 
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware. 

The advent of code starts every year from 2015 until now in December (like any other advent calendar). Every day of December 2 new puzzles come out. 1 puzzle to get familiar with the input of the day and the Christmas themed problem of the day. Once the first puzzle is solved correctly you unlock the second puzzle of the day. This solution is slightly different than the first one, but uses the same input. Most of the times I just had to recode some lines from the code I used to solve puzzle one. You get stars for each puzzle you complete.

You can participate as well! Just go to [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Personal Results:

All the codes are written in Python and can be found in the years corresponding directory.
